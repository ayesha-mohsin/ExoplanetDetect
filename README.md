# Automated Exoplanet Detection and Analysis: Leveraging Machine Learning to unveil Astronomical Insights
Using deep learning to automate the detection and analysis of exoplanets through light curve and spectral data

1. Introduction
   
In the vastness of the cosmos, a fundamental question persists: Are we alone? Humanity has tirelessly pursued the quest to unravel signs of life beyond our planet. This exploration comprises two vital tasks: identifying exoplanets, including those potentially habitable, and studying their atmospheric properties through spectroscopy to assess habitability. This project focuses on the initial phase â€” discovering exoplanets. Historically, this has been a laborious endeavor, resulting in the detection of only approximately 4000 exoplanets over two decades. However, leveraging machine learning can automate and expedite this process significantly.

Exoplanets, planets beyond our solar system, reveal themselves through a technique known as transit photometry. As an exoplanet orbits its host star, it intermittently obstructs a portion of the star's light, causing a momentary dip in light intensity. Analyzing the depth and duration of these light dips aids in identifying and confirming exoplanets, providing valuable insights into their presence and characteristics within distant star systems. NASA has diligently collected this data using the Kepler Space Telescope, making it publicly available. This dataset serves as the foundation for automating exoplanet detection through machine learning and deep learning techniques.

2. Motivation

The exploration for exoplanets is a crucial step toward comprehending the possibility of life existing beyond Earth. Researchers traditionally faced a slow exoplanet discovery process due to the manual analysis of vast and complex astronomical data. Analyzing light curves and detecting subtle patterns required meticulous human scrutiny. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can expedite this process by autonomously sifting through immense datasets, swiftly identifying patterns and anomalies in the light curves, enabling rapid and accurate detection of exoplanetary transits, thus revolutionizing the pace of discovery. By automating and accelerating the detection of exoplanets through advanced technologies like machine learning, it is possible to  greatly enhance the ability to identify celestial bodies that may harbor life. This project is fueled by the desire to expedite exoplanet discovery, unlocking a deeper comprehension of our universe and the tantalizing possibility of life existing beyond our home planet.
